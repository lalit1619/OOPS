/*Inheritance : Actors star_border
Design a class Person and two sub classes Actor and Actress. Every Actor will have a name, color, number_of_eyes & debut_year associated with him/her.

Supply each with a constructor that sets the Person data Ô¨Åelds as described with given values, and a method named toString() that returns a string that contains a complete description of the Actor.

The constructor should be in the following format

Actor(name,color,number_of_eyes,debut_year)
And the same for class Actress.

Sample input

Amitabh
BROWN
2
1965
Hema
White
2
1975
Sample output

The person Amitabh is an Actor. He is BROWN in color, has 2 eyes and debut in 1965
The person Hema is an Actress. She is White in color, has 2 eyes and debut in 1975
